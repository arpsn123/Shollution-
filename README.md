## üìå Overview  

Neurons form the foundation of brain function, and their **branching complexity** is a critical aspect of how they process information. Understanding neuronal morphology can provide insights into **developmental neuroscience, neurodegenerative diseases, and computational neuroscience models**.  

One of the most widely used methods to quantify neuronal branching is **Sholl Analysis**, a mathematical technique that examines how a neuron's dendritic complexity changes with distance from the soma (cell body). By analyzing where branches intersect with a series of concentric circles centered on the soma, researchers can evaluate how neurons grow, remodel, or deteriorate under various conditions.  

This repository provides a **fully automated computational approach** to Sholl Analysis, leveraging:  
- **Automated vs. manual soma detection** for precise image processing  
- **Polynomial regression** for capturing non-linear growth patterns  
- **Advanced model evaluation** using statistical metrics like **R¬≤, AIC, and BIC**

## üìñ Understanding Sholl Analysis  

### üî¨ Why Analyze Neuronal Branching?  
Neurons form intricate networks, where dendrites receive signals and pass them to the soma for processing. The **degree of branching** influences:  
- **Information integration:** More branches allow more synaptic connections.  
- **Neuroplasticity:** Dendritic remodeling occurs in response to learning and memory.  
- **Disease progression:** Neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's are marked by dendritic atrophy.  

Sholl Analysis quantifies **how dendritic complexity changes with distance from the soma**, revealing critical insights into neuronal structure and function.  

### üîπ How Sholl Analysis Works  
1. **Placing Concentric Circles:** Starting from the soma, evenly spaced circles are drawn outward.  
2. **Counting Intersections:** The number of dendritic branches crossing each circle is recorded.  
3. **Plotting the Profile:** A curve is generated, showing how branching density changes with distance.  
4. **Fitting a Mathematical Model:** To capture trends in branching patterns, we apply polynomial regression.

## üèπ Soma Detection: Automated vs. Manual  

A fundamental step in Sholl Analysis is **identifying the soma**, as it serves as the reference point for all measurements. This project supports two methods:  

### üîπ **Automated Soma Detection** (Less Accurate)  
- Uses **OpenCV‚Äôs minMaxLoc() function** to find the **brightest pixel**, assuming it corresponds to the soma.  
- A **binary mask** is generated to determine the centroid.  
- **Problem:** This method is highly **sensitive to uneven lighting**, which can misidentify the soma in complex images.  

### üîπ **Manual Soma Selection** (More Accurate)  
- The user **clicks on the soma**, ensuring precise placement.  
- Eliminates errors caused by variations in image intensity.  
- **Trade-off:** Requires manual input, making it slightly slower but significantly more reliable.  

**Conclusion:** Automated detection is not always reliable, especially in high-noise images. **Manual selection is recommended** for greater accuracy.

## üìä Polynomial Regression for Improved Analysis  

Instead of assuming a simple linear relationship between distance and branching complexity, this approach uses **polynomial regression** to fit a more flexible curve to the data.  

### **Why Polynomial Regression?**  
- **Neuronal branching does not follow a simple pattern**‚Äîa higher-degree polynomial can better model changes in complexity.  
- **Polynomial models capture the peak branching density** and its decline with distance.  
- **It smooths the data**, reducing the effects of noise in raw intersection counts.  

By fitting a polynomial of degree **4**, this model ensures that small variations in the data do not distort the overall trend.

## üìà Key Metrics for Model Evaluation  

### ‚úÖ **R-Squared (R¬≤)**  
Measures how well the polynomial regression fits the data. A higher R¬≤ value indicates that the model accurately represents dendritic complexity.  

### ‚úÖ **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)**  
A metric used to balance **model accuracy vs. complexity**. A lower AIC means the model fits well **without overfitting**.  

### ‚úÖ **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)**  
Similar to AIC but imposes a **harsher penalty on complex models**. Helps ensure that the polynomial degree is not unnecessarily high.
